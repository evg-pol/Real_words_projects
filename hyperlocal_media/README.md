# The project objectives 
The research is essential for the initial market analysis for clients planning to launch a new hyperlocal media outlet in a social media VKontakte. VKontakte is  one of the most popular social platforms in the post-socialist states. The aim of the research was to identify the main topics discussed in existing hyperlocal media (groups in social media) outlets in Perm Krai, Russia. Based on the analysis, clients were provided with a list of topics that have the potential to be popular for promoting their new media outlet.

# Project description
The research focused on the largest and most active hyperlocal media outlets in Perm Krai, where a wide range of topics were discussed, including urban development, public life, leisure, culture, and employment opportunities. A total of 329 groups were selected for the sample. The majority of these groups consisted of news outlets, citizen journalism, and classified ads groups. All posts in the selected groups were collected from January 1, 2021, to June 1, 2023, using the Popsters service. The total sample comprised more than 180 thousand posts, with a combined word count of more than million in the analyzed posts.

The analysis of the posts consisted of three main stages: 
- Stage 1 involved calculating the most frequently used words in posts and creating a word cloud to identify prevalent discussion topics.
- Stage 2 conducted a semantic analysis to understand the context in which words like 'Perm' or 'Perm Krai' were used in posts, offering insights into the city's image.
- Stage 3 included clustering the text data, essentially grouping the content.
